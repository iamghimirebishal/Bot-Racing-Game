## 💡 Project Motivation

This project was created by **The Binary Bots** — a team of enthusiastic robotics and programming learners — to explore the fundamentals of **AI motion control**, **path following**, and **game development** using **Python and Pygame**.  

The goal was to simulate a fun yet technical racing environment where players compete against an AI bot that follows a defined racing path, showcasing how simple automation logic can create an engaging gaming experience.
